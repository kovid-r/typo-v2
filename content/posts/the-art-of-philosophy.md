Philosophy begins in wonder. And at the end, when philosophical thought has done its best, the wonder remains. There are indeed philosophical problems that are as profound as they are clear; the problem of free will, the nature of mind, the mystery of time, the paradox of knowledge.

The philosopher's quest is for understanding, not just knowledge. Knowledge can be transmitted, but understanding must be achieved by each person individually. It is a personal conquest, not a gift. This is why philosophy cannot be taught, but only learned.

The history of philosophy is not a history of answers, but a history of questions. The great philosophers are not those who provided final solutions, but those who asked the right questions. Socrates, the father of Western philosophy, claimed to know nothing except the fact of his own ignorance. His method was not to teach, but to question.

Philosophy is not a body of doctrine but an activity. It is a way of thinking about certain sorts of question. Its aim is to clarify our thoughts, not to provide new information about the world. It is concerned not with the truth of empirical propositions, but with the logical relations between propositions.

The value of philosophy is, in fact, to be sought largely in its very uncertainty. The person who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of their age or their nation, and from convictions which have grown up in their mind without the cooperation or consent of their deliberate reason.

Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never traveled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.
